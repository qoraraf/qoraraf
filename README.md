👋 Hi, I’m @qoraraf

👀 I’m interested in Data Science

🌱 I've completed "Programming for data science with python" nanodegree at udacity-Misk. Right now very busy with "AI data engineering" master program at Simplilearn with SDA and with "Data Scientist" nanodegree with Udacity-Misk-Sdaia

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginners projects in data science and machine learning
